The EU1KY antenna analyzer V3 is an open source project to build your own, reasonably cheap but very functional antenna analyzer that is a handful tool for tuning coax-fed shortwave ham radio and CB antennas. Parameters are similar to known RigExpert AA-170, but color TFT LCD and some features outperform it in usability. Moreover, you have fun building this tool on your own and save some money.

See [Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/kuchura/eu1ky_aa_v3/wiki/Home) for details.

Project is ready for use with EmBitz IDE, ver.1.11.
